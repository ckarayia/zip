      	<p><b>CALL FOR ARTISTS ~ ZIP IS BACK!</b></p>
      	<br>

		<p>For our third installment, we are proud to announce this year’s theme:</p>
		<p><b>PASS–PORTALS: REPRESENTATION AND IDENTITY ACROSS DIGITAL REALMS</b></p>
		<p>The struggle to gain citizenship in America, where it was once the land of possibilities, has become increasingly difficult. </p>
		<p>Our goal is to showcase a group of national and international artists to create a dialog of identity and what it means to be human in the twenty first century amidst an age of technology and non-physical internet representation.</p>

		<p>We will be representing art from a variety of mediums, not regularly seen beyond the non-physical sphere of the internet. We hope that artists displayed in conjunction with each other will open a conversation on the value of inclusivity, collaboration and support. </p>
		<br>
		<br>
